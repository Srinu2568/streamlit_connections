This is a streamlit app for demonstrating st.ExperimentalBaseConnection and is a part of streamlit connections hackathon.

This app retrieves data from the starwars api 'swapi.dev', and displays it.

The connection to the api is maintained by creating a new connection using ExperimentalBaseConnection.
